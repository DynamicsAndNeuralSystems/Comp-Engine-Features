                    <h3>The Research</h3>
                    <ul className="list">
                        <li><strong>CompEngine: Time-Series Features</strong> is based on active research on a
                            highly comparative approach to data analysis, in which we aim to unify
                            disparate scientific methods through large-scale empirical comparison.
                            It is a companion website to <a href="https://www.comp-engine.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CompEngine: Time Series</a>,
                            which is focused on time-series data. The research underlying these projects is
                            currently led by Ben Fulcher at the <a href="https://dynamicsandneuralsystems.github.io" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Neural Systems and Signals Group</a>.
                            <br/>Our aims are as follows:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To assist the selection of appropriate methods for time-series data by allowing researchers working with time-series analysis
                                    methods to easily understand how methods developed in different literatures are related to each other.</li>
                                <li>To encourage the development of new and useful methods for time series by allowing researchers to understand how
                                    their new method is related to a wide range of existing methods.</li>
                            </ul>

                            analysis package, where you can find open code to implement all features included on this website,

                    <ul className="list">
                        <li>In our library of time-series analysis methods,
                            we assess the similarity between all pairsâ€”analysis methods are judged as similar that give similar patterns of outputs across diverse types of empirical time-series data.
                            Formally, this similarity is quantified using the Spearman correlation coefficient between outputs computed across 1000 empirical time series.

                        <li>On <strong>CompEngine: Time Series Features</strong>,
                            you can explore relationships between a wide range of different time-series analysis methods,
                            and understand how they behave on time-series data, using a range of tabular and quantitative statistics, as well as interactive visualizations.
                            You can also upload your own analysis function to see how it behaves relative to existing methods.
                            Then, take your analysis even further by downloading the results, or running tailored analyses, such as comparing performance on a specific dataset (an
