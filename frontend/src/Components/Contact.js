                    This website is based on active research on a highly comparative approach to data analysis,
                    in which we aim to unify disparate scientific methods through large-scale empirical comparison.
                    This research began in 2008, led by <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nick.jones">Nick Jones</a>,
                    and is currently led by Ben Fulcher at the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://dynamicsandneuralsystems.github.io">Neural Systems and Signals Group</a>.
                    We aim to continue to refine this website to incorporate developments in our research.
                    This website was developed with support from Google via the Google Summer ofÂ  Code Program:
                    front-end and back-end development of this website was done by Salman Khan (2020) and <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://diptanshumittal.github.io/portfolio-website/">Diptanshu Mittal</a> (2021),
                    supervised by Ben Fulcher and Oliver Cliff at The University of Sydney.
